GMTK Game Jam 2021 Submission @ https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021/rate/1081854 for the theme: "**Joined Together**"

**Rated #944 in originality out of 5757 entries, it was written in Processing in 48 hours, along with all the art and music.**

Its a short 2D game about 'finding' a set number of tiles that are required per level, with further levels requiring more tiles and being faster paced. The world is generated with a perlin noise function for smooth transitions with varying values corresponding to different tiles.

 What I learned:

- Loading, displaying and transitioning between 2d animations
- Perlin noise functions are awesome

How I could change/improve this game:

- Make the lights join together so that the player could 'grow' a big chunk of light, this would lead to a interesting game of maintaining the border similar to the problems experienced by 117AD where there weren't enough soldiers to man the borders from external factions.

Coding only took a few hours and the rest of the time was spent on conceptualizing and art, so by focusing more on coding and less on art I should be able to create more varied and interesting mechanics in future games.
